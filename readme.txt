1. Compression.java file is the starting point. Please run this java file.
It will generate 100 random strings and for each random string the program will compress
the string in 3 different modes (best compression, default_compression and best speed) and then will decompress again to get back the original random string. This process verifies the correctness of the compression and decompression methods.

2. Utility.java file contains the methods for generating random strings and also implementations for compression and decompression methods using Deflater and Inflater classes.
